## Why ?

Well, i was hosting this website on [AdKyNet webservers](https://adkynet.com) (great french hosting company) but their DDOS protection failed to maintain the website up for a week.

I was thinking about migrating my website to Github Pages but the fact that i can't execute server-side/worker code.

I didn't liked the Vercel experience that i had, i was feeling that was more adapted for Next.JS (aka their framework)

So here i am, hosting this website on Cloudflare pages

Have a good day
